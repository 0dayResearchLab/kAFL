# âœ¨ Improvements

- Fuzzer / QEMU:
  Dump snapshot metadata into `$WORKDIR/snapshot/state.yml`, and parse that file on fuzzer shutdown to update it's own IP filters configuration. (see [`kafl.fuzzer#68`](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kafl.fuzzer/pull/68), [`kafl.qemu#10`](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kafl.qemu/pull/10))

  This avoids having to pass IP filters through the `hprintf` channel, parse logs and extract them on the host, to send them again to `kafl cov` for coverage.
